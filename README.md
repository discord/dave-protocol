This repository contains the [protocol whitepaper](protocol.md) for Discord's Audio & Video End-to-End Encryption (DAVE) protocol. It is additionally viewable at [daveprotocol.com](https://daveprotocol.com).

Beginning September 2024, supporting Discord clients prefer to use end-to-end encryption for DM/GDM calls, server voice channels (excluding stage channels), and Go Live streams. In 2025, all official Discord clients will support the protocol and it will be an enforced requirement to connect to the end-to-end encryption eligible audio/video session types listed above.
